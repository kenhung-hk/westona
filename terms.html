                            Subscriptions purchased via the iTunes/App Store are subject to iTunes/App Store refund
                            policies. This means we cannot grant refunds if you purchased an app through iTunes/App
                            Store - you will have to contact store support for that. Payments made using prepaid cards

                            to the terms of service of the reseller from which the product was purchased. For payments
                            made in cryptocurrency, the equivalent amount in US Dollars will be refunded in the same
                            cryptocurrency (based on the rate of exchange at the moment of refund).

                            Reasonable efforts are taken to improve the accuracy and integrity of the Services, but
                            complex software is never wholly free from defects, errors and bugs. We give no warranty or

                            downtime, loss of data, corrupt data, service delay, mistakes, out-of-date information, or
                            other. Notwithstanding any other provision of these Terms, we reserve the right to change,

                            use of or access to the Services, for any reason and without notice or liability. Our
                            Services may be unavailable from time to time due to human, digital, mechanical,

                            downtime may occur and cannot control the duration of such downtime.

                            subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as
                            a "terrorist supporting" country; and (2) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of
                            prohibited or restricted parties.

                            14. Miscellaneous
                            <p></p>
                            We reserve the right to modify and update these Terms at our sole discretion, at any time,
                            for any reason, and without liability.
                            <p></p>
                            We also reserve the right to modify or update the operation of the Services at our sole
                            discretion, at any time, for any reason, and without notice or liability. We may even
                            suspend the Services entirely, in which event we will notify you in advance unless
                            extenuating circumstances, such as safety or security concerns, prevent us from doing so.
                            <p></p>
                            The Terms constitute an agreement between you and us regarding the use of the Services. The
                            parties acknowledge that no reliance is placed on any representation made but not expressly
                            contained in these Terms.
                            <p></p>
                            If any provision of the Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall
                            be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms shall otherwise
                            remain in full force and effect and enforceable.
                            <p></p>
                            You may not assign these Terms or any rights or interest under these Terms or delegate any
                            obligations to be performed under these Terms, without the Westona- PLandlord's prior
                            written consent.
                            Westona- PLandlord can assign its rights and obligations under these Terms to selected third
                            parties
                            without your consent, including but not limited to, in cases of corporate reorganization,
                            merger, acquisitions, sale or transfer of all or substantially all of company assets.
                            <p></p>
                            These Terms shall be governed in all respects by the substantive laws of Panama, without
                            regard to its choice of law provisions. You agree that the courts of general jurisdiction
                            located in Panama will have exclusive jurisdiction over any and all disputes arising out of
                            or relating in any way to these Terms or the Services.
